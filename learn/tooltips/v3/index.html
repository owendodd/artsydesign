        <p>Bereft and slightly whim, like appliances from a future dystopia, Bandau’s sculptures made half a century ago look surprisinglycontemporary today. Consider Fahrbare schwarze Sesselgruppe (Driveable Black Group of Chairs) (1971), a pair ofblack and chrome forms on casters joined by drooping hoses; and Fingerbank (1979), a collection of pendulous blacktubes encased in glass—both of which featured prominently in “Ungestalt,” a group show at the Kunsthalle Basellast summer, alongside work by a multi-generational group of artists, from Marcel Duchamp to <a class="artist link">Adrián Villar Rojas</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Bandau graduated from the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1960, around the same time as Gerhard Richter and Joseph Beuys,and has shown steadily since the late ’60s, but renewed interest in his work has elevated him into a new sphere.The artist’s cutting-edge sensibility also garnered the attention of young, tastemaking galleries in Europe, and he’s now on the roster at both Super Dakota in Brussels and Galerie Thomas Fischer in Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>A recent solo exhibition at the former presented works from the artist’s near-six-decade career—including preciselyrendered watercolors with overlapping geometric washes in black and grey, which he began creating in the early 1980s—introducing the pioneering octogenarian to a younger guard that had no idea what they’d been missing.
